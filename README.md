# Pokedex
A Pokedex is an encyclopedia (or album) of different Pokemon species, representing each Pokemon as a small “sprite” image. Here, a Pokedex entry (referenced by the sprite image) will link directly to a Pokemon card, which is a card of information for a single Pokemon species, containing a larger image of the Pokemon, its type and weakness information, its set of moves, health point data, and a short description

In v1, I have implemented the views for a Pokedex and two Pokemon cards using AJAX. 

The API are stored in https://webster.cs.washington.edu/pokedex/pokedex.php https://webster.cs.washington.edu/pokedex/game.php

In v2, I have created back end services that allows two players to trade pokemons, update Pokemon names, insert and delete pokemons from a pokedex database created in MySQL.
